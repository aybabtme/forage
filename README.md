# Forage
## Never be lost again

Forage is the result of [Serena Ngai](http://github.com/serenangai) and [Edward Ocampo-Gooding](http://github.com/edward) being asked “ohai, I’m looking for a place to (eat|drink|have fun) near the office – know anywhere?”

Mega awesome contributing authors include: [Ian Mortier](http://github.com/healthcare) (design!), Kevin Mcphillips (code!), Chris Lobay (design!), Brittany Forsyth (places!), Courtney Symons (places!), Lisa Danay (places!), and [everyone else who we collaboratively roped in](https://github.com/edward/forage/graphs/contributors) to help out (love!).

Forage is copyright Shopify Inc. 2013 and was produced during our September Hackdays.

## Future Features

* Speeeeeed – this thing feels pretty slow; moar caching and possibly using a redis back for the tags could help, but we haven’t really started looking at where the slow parts are
* Easier contributions of places + curating those suggestions
* Fave stars for places + feedback to those who suggested the place that got the fave
